# Android-Studio-Projects

> 1. **Activity Lifecycles** : A directed graph of all the states an activity can be in, and the callbacks associated with transitioning from each state to the next one.

> 2. **Animations** : Property Animation API was introduced by Google in Android 3.0 which gives us the flexibility to change object properties over a certain time interval. The Animations Framework allows us to create visually attractive animations and transitions in our apps.

> 3. **Arduino Billing** : A simple application to understand user inputs through edittextbox and applying mathematical operations on input data.

> 4. **Armstrong number** : Introducing Intents and checking conditions on the input data along with onClickListeners on Button to perform certain operations to call specific methods.

> 5. **Booking App** : Getting familiar with xml codes for frequently used components like radio button group, edit text box, button, and Toasting a message in java.

> 6. **Broadcasts** : receiver and sender apps and a dynamic way of sending broadcasts through intentfilters and implementing onReceive method.

> 7. **Calculator** : A simple calculator implementation.

> 8. **Adapter View** : Understand ListView using array adapter, usage of spinners and checkbox listeners. AdapterView is a ViewGroup that displays items loaded into an adapter. The most common type of adapter comes from an array-based data source.

> 9. **Alert Dialog Box** : Simple alert dialog boxes to input data dynamically from the user. Alert boxes have three components: Title and icon, body followed by action buttons like ok, cancel, skip etc. 

> 10. **Chip Buttons** : Chips are compact elements that represent an attribute, text, entity, or action. They allow users to enter information, select a choice, filter content, or trigger an action. For example, while you add or remove email ids while writing an email. A ChipGroup is used to hold multiple Chips.

> 11. **Time Picker Dialog Box** : Extend the dialogfragment interface to implement the dialogs such as time or date pickers.

> 12. **Date Picker** : Writing the xml code for date picker. Uncomment in activity_xml file to do the same for time pickers.

> 13. **Floating Action Buttons** : Understanding the usage and implementation of FABs, adding chip buttons and removing chip buttons are the actions provided in the expanded FAB.

> 14. **Custom List View** : Implement your view in a layout.xml file and list each item in the same layout as you define. It is difficult to add several items seperately, instead creating a single view for all such elements. You can also use Intents onClick of a particular view to display more about the selected view.
 
> 15. **Notifications and Intents** : Three things to note - Notification Channel, Notification Manager and Building the same. Using intents when you click on a particular notification.

> 16. **Covid Application** : Simple application to unterstand different components such as user inputs through checkboxes, and information sending to multiple activities via Intents and getExtra/putExtras.

> 17. **Currency Converter** : Understand the usage of radiogroup buttons. 

> 18. **Date and TIme Pickers** : Setting difference in dates and times.

> 19. **Event Listeners** : Understanding the setOnClickListeners through simple calculation.

> 20. **External Storage Application** : Writing data publicly or privately or viewing the information of external storage utility. Note: Run this application in dark mode.

> 21. **Custom Recycler** :  Set up your own layout for a recycler view. Recycler views are used for loading only the list of items present in the frame, instead of loading all of the items before hand.

> 22. **Gallery or Grid View** : Display the elements in the form of grids, you can set your number of columns as required.

> 23. **
